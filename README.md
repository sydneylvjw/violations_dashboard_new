# Overview
This dashboard displays Philadelphia's residential housing code violations that were issued between 2013 and 2024. The purpose of this app is to provide city councilmembers with a visual representation of housing condition issues within their district so they can target areas for assistace and rehabilitation resources.

# Usage
Users can opt to filter down by council district or violations city-wide. From there, they can choose which neighborhood characteristic is displayed at the census tract level--a legend will populate in the lower right of the map. 

The Code Violations filters allow you to select one or multiple years, case statuses, L&I Inspection Districts, case resolution description, and priority. As the user navigates through the filters, a KPI panel at the top of the sidebar will populate providing more detailed information about your filter results. 

Clicking on an individual violation will populate the key performance indicators (KPI) widget at the top of the sidebar. To remove any filters, simply click "Clear" (for council district) or "Clear All" (for filters).
